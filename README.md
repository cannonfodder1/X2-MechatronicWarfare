# X2-MechatronicWarfare

This is a released mod that I developed for XCOM 2. In the game, one of the units that the player can control, robotic soldiers known as SPARKs, have been neglected by the developers and lack a clear role in gameplay. This is a total overhaul mod that aims to bring SPARKs in line with the other classes in power and utility. Nearly every ability the SPARK uses has been thrown out the window and either replaced with entirely new abilities or rewritten to be more useful. Currently the mod has 99% upvotes and over 12,000 downloads: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1499767042

A few of the files were originally created by other mod authors, but each file indicated as such has been heavily modified and the original author has been clearly acknowledged in the commented code at the top of the file.
