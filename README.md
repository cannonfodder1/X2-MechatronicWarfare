# X2-MechatronicWarfare

This is a still work-in-progress mod that I'm developing for XCOM 2. In the game, one of the units that the player can control, robotic soldiers known as SPARKs, have been neglected and lack a clear role in gameplay. This is a total overhaul mod that aims to bring SPARKs in line with the other classes in power and utility. Nearly every ability the SPARK uses has been thrown out the window and either replaced with entirely new abilities or rewritten. This mod is still VERY work-in-progress. It technically works, but the code is a little messy and a few of the localization/in-game text hasn't been written yet.

A few of the files were originally created by other mod authors, but each file indicated as such has been heavily modified.
